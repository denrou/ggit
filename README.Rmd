# ggit

The goal of ggit is to help manage multiple `git` repositories.
It first list all available repositories by scanning all files recursively from a starting path.
Then, some actions can be performed such as:

+ Fetching all repositories in one command
+ Listing all repositories with a broken remote
+ Print the date of the last pull

## Installation

You can install the current version of ggit with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("denrou/ggit")
```

## Example

List all repositories located in the HOME directory

```{r example_git}
ggit::tbl_git(path = Sys.getenv("HOME"))
```

Get all contributions for all projects

```{r example_contrib}
ggit::contributions()
```


## Shiny application

A shiny application is included within the package ([`shiny`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) must be installed).
Just use:

```{r shiny, eval=FALSE}
ggit::run_app()
```

Here is a screenshot of the application:
